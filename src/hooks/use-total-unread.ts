 * Two consumers (sidebar + header) both calling `supabase.channel("…")`
 * with the same name would get back the *same* subscribed channel and blow
 * up as soon as the second one calls `.on()`. A per-call suffix sidesteps
 * that — each instance owns its own subscription.

 *
 * Lives on its own realtime channel (distinct from the inbox page's
